// NOTE: We prototype lsame_() and xerbla_() even when those symbols are
// omitted via the --omit-symbols=LIST configure option. This is done because
// the BLAS compatibility layer calls lsame_() and xerbla_() within its _check()
// functions, and we prefer to give the compiler a chance to do type checking
// against a function prototype (and *not* output a warning) even if those
// routines are not going to be compiled within BLIS.
